# CBMF4761 Computational Genomics Final Project

This project expands on the original methods of DeepTFni, as described in the following paper (available [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00469-5)):

We modified DeepTFni's original scATAC-only model to include scRNA-seq and TF-target gene relationships, allowing us to infer both TF-TF and TF-target gene relationships using a C9orf72-mediated ALS dataset. 

All sequencing data used in this study was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus repository under the accession code [GSE219281](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE219281).

## Requirements
Our version of DeepTFni is mostly written in Python 3.6 and run on Google Colab. A detailed dependency list includes:

- pytorch 1.7.1
- numpy 1.8.11
- pandas 2.1.3
- matplotlib 3.8.2
- BioPerl 1.5.7
- R 4.0.3
- fimo
- scipy 1.11.4
- tqdm 4.66.2
- networkx 3.2.1
- MAESTRO 1.5.0
- matplotlib 3.8.2
- seaborn 0.13.2
- scikit-learn 1.4.0

## Description
- *data folder*: contains zipped files for sample processed scATAC-seq/scRNA-seq data, sequencing metadata, TF-target gene binary matrix, and files from the HOCOMOCO and hTFtarget databases
- *results folder*: contains sample TRN skeletons and corresponding outputted model predictions
- *define_tf_target_matrix.ipynb*: generates the TF-target binary matrix
- *preprocess_atac_and_rna_data.ipynb*: processes the raw scATAC-seq/scRNA-seq data from GEO GSE219281 into count matrices for each patient and then combines and subsets them according to cohort and cell type
- *concatenate_rnaseq.py*: horizontally concatenate scRNA-seq data to TF RP score matrix
- *generating_network_graphs.ipynb*: creates graph networks figures to visualize the differences between the TRN skeleton and model's predicted output
- *supplementary.ipynb*: compute model performance metrics and generate confusion matrices/barplots
